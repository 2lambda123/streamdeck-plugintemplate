# From Template to Plugin in under a minute

A short guide to help you start quickly.

### Pre-requisites

- Copy or clone the template plugin.

### Search/replace a string in the template's files:

Use a your utility of choice (or your terminal) to do a full string replace using:

Replace all occurences of:

`com.elgato.template` with `your.identifier.plugin`

and

`Stream Deck Template` with `Your Plugin Name`


Fire up your preferred code-editor and open `app.js`.

Remove what you don't need and start coding (e.g. in the `onKeyDown` method)

Happy coding...
